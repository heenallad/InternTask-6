Today's Task was simply to create a Contact form with Validation using Javascript.
So I created a HTML page in which there is a reference of "style.css" & "validate.js".
For some creativity I used different colours for presenting the FORM rather than keeping it simple.
There are validation in name,email & message input through users.
Name -> only alphabets & not to be left blank, Email -> pattern matched with the email id pattern, Message -> must be of some length & submit must not be done if any kind of errors.
I provided the screenshots of Form, Successfull form submission & UnsuccessfulError form.
